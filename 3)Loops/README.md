12. A neon number is a number where the sum of digits
 of the square of the number is equal to the number. 
   Input  : 9
Output : Given number  9 is Neon number

Explanation : square of 9=9*9=81;
              sum of digit of square : 
              8+1=9(which is equal to given number)

13. For a given positive integer N, the purpose is to find the
 value of F2 + F4 + F6 +………+ F2n till N number.
 Where Fi indicates the i’th Fibonacci number.
   Input: n = 4
Output: 33
N = 4, So here the fibonacci series will be produced from 0th term till 8th term:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
Sum of numbers at even indexes = 0 + 1 + 3 + 8 + 21 = 33.

Input: n = 7
Output: 609
0 + 1 + 3 + 8 + 21 + 55 + 144 + 377 = 609.
